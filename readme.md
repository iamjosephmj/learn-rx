<h1>Learn RX</h1>

<p>Hey What's up everybody. I am Joseph James, In this project you can get a heads up to Rx-kotlin and use it in your Android Apps.
So, What is Rx-Kotlin? Why would you want to use it in your project? </p>

<p>Rx-Kotlin is an asynchronous programming library that is based on using observables. Observables are sequences of data or events that you can
 react to, such as data coming back from a web service, or even taps by the user. you can refer to the 
marble diagrams for getting a better insight about Rx's event
based programming. One thing that you should keep in your mind is that, everything is a sequence in Rx</p>

[marble diagrams playground](https://rxmarbles.com/#mapTo)

<p>As an Android developer, you are no stranger to writing asynchronous and concurrent code in order to keep your app 
snappy and responsive and your user's happy. We are talking about handling things like reacting to:</p>

- Button taps
- Keyboard animation
- Downloading data
- Processing images
- Writing to disk â€¦and lot more.

<p>And there are a lot of alternative in Android SDK like Thread, Runnable, AsyncTask, WorkManager ..etc. This
 is really where Rx-Kotlin comes into play. It allows you to write:</p>

- Declarative
- Functional and Reactive
- Consistent patterns and operators
- Handles mutable state ( Android developers will love this :) )
- Compositional
- Decoupled

<p>The learning curve for Rx is quite steep, this is the reason why developers often chooses other alternatives. The Rx-Kotlin is 
primarily based on two patterns Observable and Observer aka Publisher/subscriber, We will be creating observable sequences and observe 
them in a reactive manner. The primary base type in Rx-Kotlin in <strong>Observable<*></strong> which emits an event containing 
elements. Subscribers can react to each event emitted. Actually, an Observable doesn't emit anything unless it has at least one 
Subscriber.</p>

<p>Observables are Typed, we cannot have multiple types emitted but the same observable. Every time an emitter publishes a new element 
the Subscribers will have an opportunity to do something with the emitted value or react to that event in some other way such as displaying errors(in Android perspective). Each will observable should be terminated 
at some point which will make it stop emitting any more events. The above mentioned is the normal termination of an 
observable, there is an another way by which the observables can be terminated which is when an unexpected error occurring.
</p>

<p>So to recap of what we had seen in observables.</p>

- Next Function () => which emits value
- Complete Function() => to flag the observables as completed.
- Error Function() => to flag if an error has occurred.

<p>Now you have seen a glimpse what event based programming is. Now lets dive into the code</p>

<strong>General idea of upstream and
downstream</strong> [Ex1.kt](https://github.com/iamjosephmj/learn-rx/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/Ex1.kt)

```Kotlin
  // Upstream
Observable.just("This is my first Rx App")
    // Downstream 
    .subscribe {
        print("Observed Result: \"$it\"")
    }
```

<p>This program consists of two parts:<br>
1. Upstream<br>

```Kotlin
   Observable.just("This is my first Rx App")
```

This part emits an event <b>"This is my first Rx App"</b> of type String.<br>
</p>
<p>
2. Downstream<br>

```Kotlin
   subscribe {
    print("Observed Result: \"$it\"")
}
```

This will collect the event from the upstream and prints them.<br>

Next up, it's time for you to roll up your sleeves and get some more hands on with bread and butter of RxKotlin
</p>

<strong>Creating
Observable</strong> [Ex2.kt](https://github.com/iamjosephmj/learn-rx/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/Ex2.kt)

<p>
For explaining things in a much simpler manner, lets take the example of Game of thrones :).<br>

1. Creating observable that generates single event with .just()

```Kotlin
val mostPopular: Observable<String> = Observable.just(Season1)
```

2. Creating observable that generates multiple events with .just()

```Kotlin
val fanFav: Observable<String> = Observable.just(Season3, Season4, Season10)
```

3. Creating observable that generates multiple events with .just() on a List

```Kotlin        
val fanFavByList = Observable.just(listOf(Season3, Season4, Season10))
```

4. Creating observable that generates multiple events with .fromIterable

```Kotlin        
/* 
 * Note : the type of the fanFavByIterable will be Observable<String!>! , 
 * dont get this confused with the above one. 
*/

val fanFavByIterable = Observable.fromIterable(listOf(Season3, Season4, Season10))
```

you can also do this with the help of extension functions that rx gives us on lists.

```Kotlin        

val fanFavByIterableAlternative = listOf(Season3, Season4, Season10).toObservable()
```

</p>

<strong>Creating
Subscription</strong> [Ex3.kt](https://github.com/iamjosephmj/learn-rx/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/Ex3.kt)

<p>
Subscription is one of the prime idea behind generation of observables, there may be certain 
actions that we need to do when an event is generated.

A plain Subscription will look like

```Kotlin
val observable = Observable.just(Season1, Season2, Season3)

observable.subscribe {
    println(it)
}
```

A Subscription doesn't always end up in happy path, there can be error states to, This is how we do it.

```Kotlin
 val observable = Observable.just(Season1, Season2, Season3, Season6)

observable.subscribeBy(
    onNext = {
        println(it)
    },
    onError = {
        println(it)
    },
    onComplete = {
        println("completed")
    }
)
```

the error methods throws a Throwable, now this has one more method named onCompleted. The onCompleted method is for
flagging the subscriber that the Observable had completed its event emission and will no longer emit values.
</p>
<p>
Now you had seen examples of how to emit observables, Sometimes you will want an 
observable that emits no elements, just a completed event... That's Absurd!<br>
We can do that by using .empty(). You have noticed that each observable comes with a type, as 
we have .empty() with no elements, the compiler cannot infer the types. In this case, we can use unit.

```Kotlin
 val observable = Observable.empty<Unit>()

observable.subscribeBy(
    onNext = {
        println(it)
    },
    onError = {
        println(it)
    },
    onComplete = {
        println("completed")
    }
)
```

</p>
<p>
As you can see the from the above example, there were no events generated. but you can 
see a completed event. There is one way by which you can emit nothing using the never operator.

```Kotlin
    exampleOf("Never") {
    val observable = Observable.never<Any>()

    observable.subscribeBy(
        onNext = {
            println(it)
        },
        onError = {
            println(it)
        },
        onComplete = {
            println("completed")
        }
    )
}
```

</p>
<p>
Now, what does a subscription return -> Disposable

if you want to cancel a subscription at a point of time, you can use .dispose()
function.

```Kotlin
  val observable = Observable.never<Any>()

val sub = observable.subscribeBy(
    onNext = {
        println(it)
    },
    onError = {
        println(it)
    },
    onComplete = {
        println("completed")
    }
)

sub.dispose()
```

The key idea behind the observables are to avoid memory leaks.

what if you have multiple disposable to be disposed, RxKotlin has a method to handle this issue -- CompositeDisposable

```Kotlin
  val compositeDisposable = CompositeDisposable()

val observable1 = Observable.never<Any>()
val observable2 = Observable.never<Any>()
val observable3 = Observable.never<Any>()

compositeDisposable.add(observable1.subscribeBy(
    onNext = {
        println(it)
    },
    onError = {
        println(it)
    },
    onComplete = {
        println("completed")
    }
))
compositeDisposable.add(observable2.subscribeBy(
    onNext = {
        println(it)
    },
    onError = {
        println(it)
    },
    onComplete = {
        println("completed")
    }
))

compositeDisposable.add(observable3.subscribeBy(
    onNext = {
        println(it)
    },
    onError = {
        println(it)
    },
    onComplete = {
        println("completed")
    }
))

compositeDisposable.dispose()
```

</p>

<strong>Using Create operator</strong> [Ex4.kt](https://github.com/iamjosephmj/learn-rx/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/Ex4.kt)

<p>
we can use .create() operator for creating an observable

```Kotlin

val observable = Observable.create<String> { emitter ->
    // onNext() can be called any number of times.
    emitter.onNext("Event 1")
    emitter.onNext("Event 2")
    emitter.onNext("Event 3")
    emitter.onComplete()
}
observable.subscribeBy(
    onNext = {
        print(it)
    },
    onError = {

    },
    onComplete = {

    }
)


//Error condition

val observable = Observable.create<String> { emitter ->
    emitter.onNext("Event 1")
    emitter.onNext("Event 2")
    // This will only be triggered once.
    emitter.onError(Error.MyError())
    emitter.onNext("Event 3")
    emitter.onComplete()

}
observable.subscribeBy(
    onNext = {
        print(it)
    },
    onError = {
        print(it)
    },
    onComplete = {

    }
)
```

There are some other reactive elements other than Observables, they are:
<br>
1. <b>Single</b> : Can emit one Error or one Completed event (you can see the implementation of single in combination with Retrofit)
<br>   
2. <b>Completable</b>: Can return one Error or one Completed event
3. <b>Maybe</b>: Can emit either one Next/Error/Completed event
<br>
<br>
<b>Creating a Single</b>
   
```Kotlin
        val single = Single.create<String> { emitter ->
            emitter.onSuccess("Completed Successfully")
        }
        single.subscribeBy(
            onSuccess = {
                println(it)
            },
            onError = {

            }
        )
```   
</p>

<strong>Subject and non ending sequences of streams</strong> [Ex5.kt](https://github.com/iamjosephmj/learn-rx/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/Ex5.kt)
<p>
Subjects are comprised of two parts :
<br>
1. <b>Observable</b> (just like that you have seen before)
<br>
2. <b>Observer</b> : This can receive new events, upon receiving new events it will be passed to the subscribers.
<br>
They are kind of like a Yin and Yang combination of Observable and Observer, This gives us capability of 
working with observables that are not finite sequences. New elements can be added to the Subject at 
runtime, and they will be emitted to Subscribers.
</p>
<p>
There are 3 types of subjects that we use:
<br>
<b>1.Publish Subject</b><br>
This starts as an empty sequence and emits only new next events to its subscribers. In other words, Elements 
added to PublishSubject before the subscription will not be received by the subscriber.

```Kotlin
  val compositeDisposable = CompositeDisposable()
        val seasonBroadcast = PublishSubject.create<String>()
        seasonBroadcast.onNext(Season1)
        seasonBroadcast.onNext(Se   ason2)
        val subscriber1 = seasonBroadcast.subscribeBy {
            println("Subscription from subscriber 1 , data = $it")
        }

        compositeDisposable.add(subscriber1)

        seasonBroadcast.onNext(Season3)
        seasonBroadcast.onNext(Season4)
        seasonBroadcast.onNext(Season5)
        seasonBroadcast.onNext(Season6)
        seasonBroadcast.onNext(Season7)
        seasonBroadcast.onNext(Season8)
        seasonBroadcast.onNext(Season9)
        compositeDisposable.dispose()

        seasonBroadcast.onNext(Season10)

```
<b>Behaviour Subject</b><br>
Sometimes, you want the new subscribers to receive the most recent next event. 
even if they subscribe after that event was originally emitted. For this we can use 
BehaviourSubject. They start with an initial value, and they will replay the latest value 
to the new subscribers.They are <b>Stateful</b> (you can access the latest state anytime)

```Kotlin
  val compositeDisposable = CompositeDisposable()

        val sendBroadcast = BehaviorSubject.createDefault(Season1)

        /*
        *  You can access the behaviour subject value in the below way.
        *  This can particularly be helpful in UI related stuff.
         */
        println("value of the Subject is :${sendBroadcast.value}")

        val sub1 = sendBroadcast.subscribeBy(onNext = {
            println(it)
        }, onComplete = {
            println("completed 1")
        })

        compositeDisposable.add(sub1)
        compositeDisposable.clear()

        sendBroadcast.onNext(Season2)
        val sub2 = sendBroadcast.subscribeBy(onNext = {
            println(it)
        }, onComplete = {
            println("completed 2")
        })

        compositeDisposable.add(sub2)
```

<b>Replay</b><br>
What if you want to replay more than just one event other than the latest value... ReplaySubject comes to the rescue. 
It starts empty, but is initialized with ab buffer size, It will replay upto that bufferSize to the new subscribers.
We should not make the buffer size larger, because it will be held in the memory for the life of the subject.

```Kotlin
  val compositeDisposable = CompositeDisposable()

        val subject = ReplaySubject.create<String>(2)

        subject.onNext("event 1")
        subject.onNext("event 2")

        compositeDisposable.add(
            subject.subscribeBy {
                println(it)
            }
        )

        subject.onNext("event 3")
```

<strong>Operators</strong> [Ex6.kt](https://github.com/iamjosephmj/learn-rx/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/Ex6.kt)
<p>
Operators are the building blocks of Rx, which you can use to filter, transform, process and react to events emitted by observables. You 
can chain this operators to perform complex operations in a very succinct and understandable way when you go back review that 
code later.

we can start by looking into filtering operators, which allow you to process some events but ignore others.
Then we will move on to transforming operators, which allow you to manipulate events and data that are emitted by an 
observable in order to prepare it for subscribers. 

<b>Filtering Operator</b><br>
In a nutshell, this applies conditional constraints to next events to only pass through 
to subscribers the elements you want. 

Let's jump right in with [ignoreElements()](https://rxmarbles.com/#ignoreElements) <br>
As shown in the marble diagram, ignoreElements() will ignore next events. However, it will allow 
through stop events, In other words Completed or Error events. Allowing through stop events are usually 
implied in marble diagrams. We are just explicitly calling it out this time because 
that's all ignoreElements will let through.
<br>

[elementAt()](https://rxmarbles.com/#elementAt) <br>
This will filter next events except the one at the specified index. This marble 
diagram depicts using elementAt() to only return the 3rd next event element and ignore the rest.
<br>
[filter { }](https://rxmarbles.com/#filter) <br>
RxKotlin also has a filter operator for observable sequence that works similarly to kotlin's 
filter function for collections. It takes a predicate to apply to each element to determine 
if the element should be allowed through or not. In this marble diagram it will allow to pass 
the elements that are greater than 10 only.
